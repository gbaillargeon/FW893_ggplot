#Questions for Lesson 2 and 3 

#Lesson 2:
#  1. I had a high level of comfort with application.  I learned the format and basics of how to label data and manipulate the plot output. 
#  2. I am not really confused on anything besides the purpose of mapping, why is it necessary we use that function?
#  3. I definitley will need to make lots of scatter plots to see the relaitonship between two variables so this was very helpful. 
#  4. Maybe a bit more about how to add more components or where to find good informaiton on this. 

#Lesson 3:
# 1. My level of comfort was high with this application.  It was easy to find where I needed to edit the lesson code to fulfil the applicaiton requriements.
# 2. I feel comfortable with all of the lesson.
# 3. Styling the text and points, and creating linear regression line with fill is very applicable to my work.
# 4. Something that came up when I was doing this application was learning how to make contour graphs, or at least put in a color gradation in the background of a graph.
