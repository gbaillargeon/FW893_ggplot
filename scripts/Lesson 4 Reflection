Lesson 4 Reflection:

1)	What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

I was pretty comfortable with the lesson. Having the backbone of the code presented in the lesson and then being able to isolate what areas need to be adjusted to fit the application is really helpful.  If I had to code this type of plot start to finish without a base of code to work with it would be more difficult. I have edited dataframes in python before so it was cool to draw comparisons to the methods in R you showed. 

2)	What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

I am a bit confused on how to adjust all of the lines in the background of the plot. I think I will need to revisit what each of the subcompenents does exactly. 

3)	What is a way you can apply the material in this lesson towards your research or area of study?

Oftentimes I am working with messy dataframes or dataframes that need to be made more uniform and usable, so the dataframe formatting was super helpful and I am sure I will apply it in the future. 

4)	What are some things you would like to learn related to, but not covered in, this lesson? 

I was curioius how you would delete or replace a dataframe column instead of just adding a new one?
