Lesson 6 Reflection:

1)	What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

I was pretty comfortable with the lesson and application.  I definitely felt more comfortable with the overall format of setting up a plot in ggplot, and with isolating columns and adding to a dataframe.

2)	What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?
I am still a bit confused about the annotate function and what its main purpose is. 


3)	What is a way you can apply the material in this lesson towards your research or area of study?
I defintiely see myself needing to make boxplots in the future. I also liked learning the factor function where I can order things manually to show up on the graph.

4)	What are some things you would like to learn related to, but not covered in, this lesson? 

How to customize the standard error shown on the boxplot based on the data.
