Lesson 8 Reflection:

1)	What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

I had a pretty high level of comfort with this application.  It was easier to understand than the boxplots lessonsin part becuase I understand how bar plots work in general, whereas I was relatively unfamiliar with the boxplots. I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of how to setup the bar plot and use the subcomponents.

2)	What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

In the thrid barplot, is there a way to label the legend to show that the red boxes are heat days and blue boxes are heat days?

3)	What is a way you can apply the material in this lesson towards your research or area of study?

Learning how to put in a horizontal line to represent a sum or average was really useful.  In general, bar plots are used to show change in one or two factors over time. Especially, stacked bar plots are frequently used in fisheries to show diet preference of fishes.


4)	What are some things you would like to learn related to, but not covered in, this lesson? 

Putting in a line that represents the moving average over time (not a straight horizontal line) would be helpful.
