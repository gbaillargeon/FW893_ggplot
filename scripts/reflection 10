Lesson 10 Reflection:

1)	What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

I found the lesson and application relatively easy to follow, and I liked that it brought together skills from previous lesson to apply here. I did not have a problem using grep, getting columns from the dataframe, or setting up the histogram ggplot structure.

2)	What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

I am still struggling to understandhow to manipulate the arrage and matrix to get the plots sized and placed correctly in a multi-panel plot. 

3)	What is a way you can apply the material in this lesson towards your research or area of study?

Multi panel plots save space in publications and are a popular option if you have lots of data or plots to compare. 


4)	What are some things you would like to learn related to, but not covered in, this lesson? 

In gneral, I think it would be important for me to learn how about animated plots in ggplot.
